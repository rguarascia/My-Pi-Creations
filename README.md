My-Pi-Creations
===============

A collection of my Pi Circuit board projects.

This repo will contain all the projects I create with my Raspberry Pi Rev 2.
Including: LEDs, Motors, Sensor amd just about anything else I can get my hands on.

I am not held reasonable for, if you break your Pi using my projects.
Use at your own risk, although they should be almost 100% stable.
